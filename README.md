The Vehicle Information Management System (VIMS) is a console-based app that captures and displays detailed car and motorcycle info. Using object-oriented principles, VIMS categorizes vehicles into Two-Wheelers and Four-Wheelers, with sealed classes for Car and Motorcycle, customizable designs via interfaces, and a VehicleType enum.
