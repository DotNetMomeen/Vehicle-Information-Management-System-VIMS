<h1>🚗 Vehicle Information Management System (VIMS) 🚗</h1>
<p>The Vehicle Information Management System (VIMS) follows the Fruits Sales Supply Management System (FSSMS) project in terms of structure and approach for several compelling reasons:</p>

<h2>🔧 Object-Oriented Design</h2>
<p>Both VIMS and FSSMS leverage object-oriented principles, ensuring a robust foundation for scalable, maintainable, and modular software development. By categorizing entities—like vehicles in VIMS and inventory in FSSMS—into distinct classes and applying inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, both systems achieve an architecture that's not only solid but also easy to extend.</p>

<h2>🧩 Separation of Concerns</h2>
<p>Just as FSSMS organizes different functionalities—such as inventory management, sales tracking, and the user interface—into well-defined components, VIMS follows suit by separating vehicle management into Two-Wheelers and Four-Wheelers. Each category has specific properties and behaviors, improving code organization and maintainability.</p>

<h2>🎨 Customizable Features</h2>
<p>Customization is a key feature in both projects. In FSSMS, this is evident in elements like automatic reorder points and POS integration, tailored specifically for the fruit industry. Similarly, VIMS allows customization through interfaces for different designs (interior and exterior) based on vehicle type, making it adaptable to the specific needs of the automotive domain.</p>

<h2>🔍 Use of Enums for Clarity & Type Safety</h2>
<p>Both FSSMS and VIMS utilize enums to categorize data with clarity and type safety. While FSSMS might use enums for product types or order statuses, VIMS uses an enum for VehicleType. This ensures consistent and easily managed vehicle categories within the codebase.</p>

<h2>👥 User-Focused Design</h2>
<p>Both systems emphasize user-friendliness. FSSMS offers a straightforward interface for managing fruit sales and inventory, whereas VIMS provides a simple console-based interface for capturing and displaying vehicle information. This focus on user experience ensures that both systems are accessible and easy to use.</p>

<h2>🚀 Why VIMS Follows FSSMS</h2>
<p>By mirroring the approach of FSSMS, VIMS inherits a well-organized, flexible, and efficient system design. This makes the development, maintenance, and extension of the application smoother and more manageable, ensuring that VIMS can evolve alongside the needs of its users.</p>
